# Development Plan	
## Consistency 
To keep in line with the design language used throughout the game itself, the website will employ and cartoony design and feel[1]. 

## Navigation
Navigation will be implemented through a constant navbar positioned at the top of each webpage. This will ensure that the user will always be able to know where they are in the site. Burger menus lack this crucial feature. Navigation will be a one click solution.

## Fonts
The font will be kept to the San-Serif derivative, Futura Font[3]. To avoid walls of text, we will use different font sizes to reflect headings, subheadings, content and sub content. However, much of the focus on will not be an text, but rather images, animations and video -- a visual experience. In this spirit, we will strive to limit the amount of text on the site to what is absolutely necessary.

## Media Type
A variety of multimedia will be used throughout the website, including files, videos, animation and flash in order to give our users more benefit from the website, keeping them on the website and ensuring a pleasant experience[4].

## Design
Since a Single Page Application design will be followed, in order avoid parallax overload we will limit the amount to content to a single non-scrollable screen.**(I sense some red flags with this statement).

## User experience
There will be a deliberate effort to avoid pop ups throughout the website, and instead, dynamically changing content will be used (through the use of jQuery and JavaScript).
