# BOMBFEST Design Proposal

## University of Pretoria

## Multimedia Trends (IMY 320)

A Proposal to Build a Website for the Promotion of BOMBFEST
First design proposal submitted to Zack Pierce for the design of the BOMBFEST promotional
website.

_The proposal is being transmitted to:
Name: Mr Yan Wong, Lecturer
Address: IT 6-61 University of Pretoria_

Proposal support
Our website aims to provide a general overview about the game, BOMBFEST and
what users should expect from the final product. The website content is delivered
through enhanced interactivity and pleasurable user experience using latest
technology trends.

## Acknowledgement

Highest appreciation To Mr Yang Wong and colleagues for devoted and
dedicated time spent on the assessment of the proposal.


## Project summary

The design proposal aims to describe a website capable of marketing and bringing as much
attention the game before it and even during release. As described on Kickstarter, much of
the funding (45 percent of the allocation) will be for marketing​[1]​. It follows that, the website,
the digital world that we live in, will be an integral part of the marketing process.

Since the actual release of the game is scheduled for January 2019, this would give us (a
team of five) enough time to create a simple, interactive, and functional website beforehand.
We would use already existing free components wherever applicable to cut development
time, all the while ensuring a non-generic design and product.

We expect that this website would do well to introduce the game to its prospective audience
and that it would be a great help throughout the marketing that would need to be done.

## Aims

```
● The design of a promotional website for BOMBFEST.
● An interactive and user centered design.
● The design will make use of integrated animations, PWA concepts, and some
particle backgrounds as per current web design trends. In addition, it will have a
Single Page Application design.
● In keeping with the current trends of design, the design will produce a product that
is both palatable in this day and age, as well as up to the necessary standards for
its audience. These are designs that work, that are relevant and that users have
tended to approve.
```
## Background

BOMBFEST is an award-winning party game for you and up to three friends! Battle in
wooden forts, on folding chairs, and inside the kitchen sink as you attempt to be the

last player standing. Use bombs to eliminate your foes, but don’t get caught in a

chain reaction of explosions!​[2]

### The Overall Need

The overall need of a website to market BOMFEST is that it is still at the Beta stage and is
only 32% funded​[2]​, it needs more marketing to get more exposure and possible funders.

### Current Status

It is currently at Beta 3.


### Enabling Technology

jQuery is a JavaScript library that supports integrated animation throughout the website. Ajax
is a tool that we would used to implement much of the Single Page Application design
concepts. Since one of the primary features of the website would be interaction, the use of
JavaScript will be particularly heavy, as well as CSS3.
HTML5 will serve as the basis of the website structure and design.
Github will be used for version control as well as collaboration on the development of the
website itself. We will use it to host all that we need, including the designs of the site, before
finally deploying the final product once finished.

### Problem to be Solved

The main problem to be solved by this project is the exposure of the game to possible target
market. Using the ​ _Pareto principle_ ​ which states that “80% of the effects come from 20% of
the causes”. Together with the The ​ _Law of the Few_ ​which states that “The 20% should be
made up of 3 types of people: Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen”. With this website we
hope help reach out to the Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen that will market the game to
the 80% that the website might not be able to reach.

## Development Plan

To keep in line with the design language used throughout the game itself, the website will
employ and cartoony design and feel​[1]​.

Navigation will be implemented through a constant navbar positioned at the top of each
webpage. This will ensure that the user will always be able to know where they are in the
site. Burger menus lack this crucial feature. Navigation will be a one click solution.

The font will be kept to the San-Serif derivative, Futura Font​[3]​. To avoid walls of text, we will
use different font sizes to reflect headings, subheadings, content and sub content. However,
much of the focus on will not be an text, but rather images, animations and video -- a visual
experience. In this spirit, we will strive to limit the amount of text on the site to what is
absolutely necessary.

A variety of multimedia will be used throughout the website, including files, videos, animation
and flash in order to give our users more benefit from the website, keeping them on the
website and ensuring a pleasant experience​[4]​.

Since a Single Page Application design will be followed, in order avoid parallax overload we
will limit the amount to content to a single non-scrollable screen.**(I sense some red flags
with this statement).


There will be a deliberate effort to avoid pop ups throughout the website, and instead,
dynamically changing content will be used (through the use of jQuery and JavaScript).

## Qualifications of the Development Group

Lesego Mabe is a final year BSc Computer Science student with both programming and web
development experience.

Tlou Lebelo is a final year BSc Computer Science student with great knowledge and interest
in web programming and technologies.

Nkosenhle Ncube is an undergraduate finalist for a BSc Computer Science degree with

## Development Facilities

Project collaboration will be handled through Github and as such the development team will
be able to develop the project separately in and in different locations. The University of
Pretoria provides their students with computer laboratories with the relevant software for
their module needs, and since this is required work for IMY 320, access will be granted.
